          My name is Erika, I'm from Colombia, I've been a tech enthusiast since
          my childhood and that's led me to pursue a career in software web
          development. I am a lifelong learner, I thrive when tackling new
          challenges, and I am self-motivated to seek out new knowledge. In my
          free time, I indulge in reading, exploring new places, listening to
          music, and keeping fit by jumping rope and cooking nutritious meals.
