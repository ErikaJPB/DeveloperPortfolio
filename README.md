Welcome to my developer portfolio! This portfolio is being built using Next.js, a framework for building server-rendered React applications, and Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. With Next.js, I was able to easily create a performant portfolio, and Tailwind CSS helped me quickly create a responsive and visually appealing design.

This portfolio includes information about my background and experience, my skills and projects, as well as a contact form for potential employers or clients to reach out to me. It also includes a blog functionality where I will be updating my readers about my recent projects and tips that I have learned.

I'm excited for you to take a look around my portfolio and see the work I've done. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out via the contact form or social media links provided.
